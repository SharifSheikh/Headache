              <i>When you have a headache, do you rush to your medicine
              cabinet or to the drugstore for a pain reliever? If so,
              you're not alone. People in the United States spend over
              $2 billion a year on nonprescription pain relievers.
              Although effective, these pain relievers are not without
              problems. First of all, which should you choose? There
              are over 100 brands, and most come in various forms
              (for example, tablets or capsules) and various strengths
              (such as regular and extra strength). Choosing a pain
              reliever can be enough to make anyone's headache
              worse! Second, the 100-plus brands fall into three
              types of pain relievers - aspirin, acetaminophen,
              and ibuprofen - and each of these can have serious side
              effects. Aspirin and ibuprofen can cause stomach irritation
              and gastrointestinal bleeding; acetaminophen can cause liver
              damage in some people.<br>So, next time you have a headache,
              instead of rushing to the drugstore, you might want to try
               one of these natural headache remedies:</i>
          </p>
          <p>
              <i><b style="color:red">1.Eat something soon.</b>
              &nbspPreferably, eat something high in protein, a substance
              necessary for growth. The "hungry headache", caused by a drop
              in the blood-sugar supply, can be a real problem for people
              not eating enough at mealtimes. Why protein? Because it
              rebuilds your blood-sugar supply little by little. Sugary
              foods cause the blood sugar to go up rapidly and then drop
              again just as fast.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
              <i><b style="color:red">2.Wash it away.</b>
              &nbsp"At the first sign of headache pain, get in the shower,"
              advises Dr. Augustus S. Rose of the UCLA (University of California
              at Los Angeles) School of Medicine. First, take a hot shower even
              if the pain gets worse. This will make the blood vessels open wide.
              Follow it immediately with a cold shower. Stay in until you shiver.
              Repeat this procedure if necessary. This process works well for
              a migraine headache. In a migraine headache, the blood vessels
              of the head first contract then dilate and press against the
              nerves. This pressure causes pain. Cold water makes the blood
              vessels contract, which eases this pressure on the nerves.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
              <i><b style="color:red">3.Think it away.</b>
              &nbspSit down or lie down and close your eyes. Imagine that it is
              summer and you are on the beach. An ocean breeze cools your face and
              your hands and arms grow warmer and warmer in the hot sun. Your hands
              are really soaking up the sun. They become hot to the touch. Minutes
              pass, and when you open your eyes, you are left with very warm hands...
              and no headache. Thinking warmth into your hands sends blood toward them
              and away from the head.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
              <i><b style="color:red">4.Massage it out.</b>
              &nbspGet to your head through your feet. Massaging the lower part of your
              big toe and the area under all your toes will lessen tension in the neck.
              This tension can often cause a headache.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
              <i><b style="color:red">5.Press it away.</b>
              &nbspSome headaches can be cured by a sensitive finger-pressure massage. The
              massage should be given on sensitive "trigger" points. There are three pairs
              of points: one at each temple, one under each shoulder blade, and a pair at
              the back of the neck. Press each point for 15 to 30 seconds at a time.
              Remember to press both points in a pair at the same time, not just one
              side. Doing this will help the body's natural painkillers start working.
              If you are alone, press the thumb of one hand against the tender spot in the
              "V" formed by the thumb and forefinger of the other hand.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
              <i><b style="color:red">6.Brush in away.</b>
              &nbsp"Find a hairbrush with fairly stiff natural bristles," says biophysicist
              Harry C. Ehrmantraut. Then use the following procedure, first on one side of
              your head and then on the other: Starting a little above your temple, just
              above your eyebrow, brush your hair in small circles. Move the brush first
              up and then back before moving it down and forward to complete your circle.
              This way the upper part of the circle goes toward the back of the head. Then
              brush down to the base of your skull. After you repeat this procedure on the
              other side of your head, brush the hair in the center of your scalp, first on
              the right and then on the left. Make small circles as you start at the top of
              your head and move down toward the base of your skull. Brushing stimulates the
               skin and the tissues underneath, so blood can flow more easily and more oxygen
                can reach the brain. Always see a doctor for continuous or recurring head pain.</i>
